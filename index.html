        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p>I must have been the most beautiful sight I’ve have had the pleasure of seeing. The rays of sunlight glimmered creating the most beautiful scene I’ve ever seen. The cloud free sky was painted in gorgeous pastel colors. The trees were red, orange, and brown. It was mid-autumn after all. The wind blew past the trees, making them rustle. In the past, I had always wanted to view the sunset, but never had the time to do so. I was always busy either with school, or my siblings. It was fine – that won’t matter anymore. In my right hand was a Desert Eagle .50 Caliber.</p>
